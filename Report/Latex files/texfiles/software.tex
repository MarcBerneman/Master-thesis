The simulations in this thesis were coded in MATLAB \cite{MATLAB}. The Frequency Domain toolbox \cite{pintelon_book} supplied the necessary functions needed for estimating nonparametric models of the FRF with the robust LPM. The IniConfig class for \mbox{MATLAB} \cite{iniconfig} was very helpful in keeping everything organized. The Multi-Parametric Toolbox for MATLAB \cite{MPT3} was useful for doing convex optimization. Finally, LTspice XVII was used for simulating the analog controller before soldering it.
