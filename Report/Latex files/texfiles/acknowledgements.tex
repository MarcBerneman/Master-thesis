Over the past 5 years I have been given a very broad education in Electrical Engineering and Engineering in general. Of all the courses I took, the ones about System and Control theory have fascinated me the most. I am therefore very grateful to have been given the opportunity to write my Master thesis about this topic.\\

\noindent
I would like to thank my supervisor Professor Pintelon and co-supervisor Professor Lataire for all their guidance and patience. They have given me the freedom to pursue my research interests, but they guided me when I needed it. \\

\noindent
I also want to express my gratitude to all the professors, assistants and lab personnel at the VUB and ULB who have shaped me into the engineer I am today.\\

\noindent
Finally, I wish to thank my parents for their support and encouragement throughout my study.\\
